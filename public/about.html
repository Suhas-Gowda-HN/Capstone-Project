<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I’m an aspiring tech enthusiast currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, expected to graduate in 2027. As someone who is deeply curious about how technology shapes the world, I’ve begun my journey by exploring the basics of Python, web development, and data science. I’m also learning tools like GitHub to document and share my growth, one small step at a time.</p>

<p>Though I consider myself an absolute beginner, I’m genuinely passionate about learning and improving every day. I believe in building skills slowly but consistently — through self-paced courses, hands-on practice, and real-world projects. My focus right now is not perfection but progress, and I’m committed to developing a strong foundation across programming, AI, and problem-solving.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I enjoy playing basketball — a sport that has taught me teamwork, discipline, and the value of staying active both mentally and physically. Whether it’s on the court or in front of the computer, I love challenging myself and finding ways to grow. I’m excited about the journey ahead and look forward to contributing to meaningful projects and innovative teams.</p>
